# FPC DOOM

In this repository i try to port DOOM to Free-Pascal using OpenGL and therefore beeing platform indipendant.

> !! Attention !!

> This is a work in Progress, don't expect anything to work (yet)..

The original code was released by [id-Software](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM) unfortunatunelly 
i was not able to get the code running so i decided to use the 
[crispy-doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) version as base (as this one directly compiled 
and was able to start and play the .wad files i have had laying around).

Also i found some usefull documentations that try to explain the code:
- https://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php
- https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_source_code
- https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_source_code
- https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_source_code_files
  
There is already a [FPC Doom](https://github.com/jval1972/FPCDoom) on the [List](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port) of 
ports, but that version only supports DirectX :/.

Progress:
- Got crispy Doom compiled
- created initial FPC_DOOM Lazarus project
- stored everything on Github
